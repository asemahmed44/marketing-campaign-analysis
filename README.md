 Marketing Campaign Analysis

Performed exploratory data analysis on a marketing campaign dataset to understand customer behavior and identify factors affecting promotional response. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and building machine learning models to predict whether customers will respond to marketing campaigns.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of the project is to analyze demographic and behavioral customer features—such as age, income, education, marital status, and spending patterns—to uncover insights that help businesses improve marketing strategy. Multiple classification models were trained to predict promotion response.

📂 Dataset
